# Background / Motivation

Learning web dev with Golang.

Lenslocked and other projects are just things I've played around with to build up my mental models.

# Tooling

- golang
- github.com/cortesi/modd for dynamic reloading through detecting code/filesystem changes. Installed using `brew install modd`. Config is in the `modd.conf` file in project root.
